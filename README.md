# Twittering Birds Frontend

## Installation

First, make sure you have the lastest Node and npm. Go to [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/), download and install it.

To get the actual Grunt command set up:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

To get the blank slate up and running:

```bash
$ npm install
```

If you don't already have [the `scss-lint` Ruby gem](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint) installed, you'll need to do that:

```bash
$ gem update --system
$ gem install scss-lint
```

And finally, to start up the project:

```bash
$ grunt
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. To see [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/)'s UI, open [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
